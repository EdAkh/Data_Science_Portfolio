## Projects
[Project 3: PPE Detection Web Application](https://github.com/EdAkh/PPE-Detection).

Computer vision project were the goal is to create a model capable to detect personal protective equipement on construction and industrial workers.
* I used Roboflow framework to store the images, labelized them and split automatically the data for train, validation and test.
* The model architecture for the training is YOLO NAS L.
* Web application built with Flask framework, with the current features: upload images from local folder or from a web link, display input and output. (more will be added)
   

[Project 2: Deep Neural Network For Energy Efficiency Prediction Model](https://github.com/EdAkh/DNN_Energy_Efficiency_Model)

In this project, I tried to work on a subject link to my old job and its my first one using deep learning.
* The data set used is from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency#) and is based on a Ecotect simulation of twelve different building, by playing with eight parameters, they obtained 768 different shapes of building for two outcomes.
* The goal is to do regression with a deep neural network (DNN), the model is made with two hidden layers, each containing 128 nodes, two nodes for each outcomes.
* Metrics used to measure the function loss and accuracy: mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.


[Project 1: SpaceX Launches Prediction Model](https://github.com/EdAkh/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)

This is a project that I did at the end of the IBM Data Sciecne Professionnal Certificate.
* The data was collected from the SpaceX API and with webscraping on Wikipedia.
* Folium and Dash were used to analyze which launchsites were the most successful and for which payload.
* Algorithms used: Logistic regression, SVM, Decision tree and KNN.
