# Data Science Portfolio

[Project 1: SpaceX Launches Prediction Model](https://github.com/EdAkh/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)

This is a project that I did at the end of the IBM Data Sciecne Professionnal Certificate.
* The data was collected from the SpaceX API and with webscraping on Wikipedia.
* Folium and Dash were used to analyze which launchsites were the most successful and for which payload.
* Algorithms used: Logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and KNN.
